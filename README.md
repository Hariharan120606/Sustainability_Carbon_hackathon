# Sustainability Carbon Hackathon

A full‚Äëstack application to monitor, visualize, and optimize carbon emissions across warehouse logistics. Built as part of the Walmart‚Äësponsored hackathon, this project features:

- **User Authentication** (JWT + Express)
- **Warehouse & Product Management** (PostgreSQL)
- **Route Optimization** (Python script)
- **Interactive Maps & Charts** (React + Leaflet + Google Maps + Chart.js)
- **Real‚Äëtime Carbon Emission Dashboard** (Redux + Chart.js)

## üé¨ Motivation

The logistics industry significantly contributes to global carbon emissions, particularly through inefficient transportation routes and warehouse operations. As sustainability becomes a core priority for major enterprises, there's a pressing need for tools that help companies:

Quantify their carbon footprint

Visualize inefficiencies in their supply chain

Optimize operations with sustainability in mind 

This project was built to address these needs during the Walmart Sustainability Hackathon. Our goal was to create an integrated platform that empowers warehouse managers and logistics coordinators to:

Track carbon emissions in real-time

Simulate and apply eco-friendly route optimizations

Make data-driven decisions that reduce environmental impact

By combining modern web technologies, geospatial data and optimization algorithms, we provide an accessible solution for sustainable supply chain management.

## üèó Architecture
Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
